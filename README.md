# **Python Challenge 1**: Program for Interactive Menu for Food Truck
***
## Description
This is a single python file to showcase the use of lists, dictionaries, else-if statements. while loops, for loops, list comprehension, match case statements, and formatting menus in Python.

## Project Status
I reached a stable state for the code. However, I may update this to develop my skills in Python with functions, modules, refactoring existing code, object-oriented programming, and deeper concepts of Python.

## Conditions
The only specification to think of for this program is that it is running on a Conda environment in Python 3.10.14 and there were no plugin functions were used.
